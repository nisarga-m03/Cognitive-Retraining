Computerized Cognitive Retraining Program (CCRP) for Home Training of Children with Disabilities
The Computerized Cognitive Retraining Program (CCRP) is designed to offer home-based training for children with developmental disabilities, helping them improve essential cognitive skills such as attention, memory, problem-solving, and executive functions. This initiative addresses the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment's problem statement in the Smart India Hackathon (Problem Statement Code: SIH1307), which seeks innovative solutions to support the cognitive development of children with disabilities through technology.

The program provides individualized, interactive exercises that are accessible from home, allowing children to practice at their own pace while offering parents the ability to track progress. With game-like elements, the CCRP aims to enhance engagement and motivation, making the learning process enjoyable and effective. The platform supports a wide range of cognitive areas and adapts based on the child's performance to ensure personalized and consistent learning.
